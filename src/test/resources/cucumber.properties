# Cucumber Parallel Execution Configuration
# ==========================================
# This configuration enables parallel test execution for API tests.
# UI tests remain sequential to avoid browser resource conflicts.

# Enable parallel execution
cucumber.execution.parallel.enabled=true

# Parallelism strategy
# - dynamic: Adjusts thread count based on available processors
# - fixed: Uses a fixed number of threads
cucumber.execution.parallel.config.strategy=fixed

# Number of parallel threads for API tests
# Recommended: 4 threads for optimal balance between speed and stability
# Adjust based on machine resources: 2-8 threads typical range
cucumber.execution.parallel.config.fixed.parallelism=4

# Execution mode
# - concurrent: Tests can run in any order
# - same_thread: Tests in same feature run sequentially (safer)
cucumber.execution.parallel.config.fixed.max-pool-size=4

# Plugin configuration for thread-safe reporting
# Cucumber reports are thread-safe by default
cucumber.plugin=pretty, \
  html:target/cucumber-reports/api/cucumber.html, \
  json:target/cucumber-reports/api/cucumber.json, \
  junit:target/cucumber-reports/api/cucumber.xml

# Disable colors in CI environments (optional)
cucumber.ansi-colors.disabled=false

# Publish results (optional - set to false for privacy)
cucumber.publish.quiet=true

# Note: These settings apply globally to all Cucumber test runners.
# For test-suite-specific configuration, use runner annotations or
# system properties: -Dcucumber.execution.parallel.enabled=false
